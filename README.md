# BinPacking
Implementation of a brute force bin packing algorithm and a heuristic. The execution time of both is compared.

The bin packing problem can be found here, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem

The optimal algorithm is O(N!), which is unrealistic for unbounded N.

I implement the brute force algorithm as well as modify one of the heuristics O(N) to visualize the execution time of both for varying N.
