# BinPacking
Implementation of a brute force bin packing algorithm and a heuristic. The execution time of both is compared.

The bin packing problem can be found here, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem

The optimal algorithm is O(N!), which is unrealistic for unbounded N.

I implement the brute force algorithm as well as modify one of the heuristics O(N) to visualize the execution time of both for varying N.

This program provides command line output based on randomly generated weights. Here is a sample output:
