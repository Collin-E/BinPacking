Brute Force approach to bin packing problem
Complexity: O(N!)

Note that bruteForce with 11 elements will take ~45 minutes. Larger than 11 elements is not recommended as it will theoretically take hours

ASSUMPTIONS: bins are max unit capacity, 1, and any elements in weights should be <= 1 while still being positive.
